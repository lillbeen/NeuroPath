> **"Information, Re-Imagined for Every Mind."**

NeuroPath is an AI-powered adaptive learning platform designed to dismantle the "cognitive walls" faced by the 1-in-5 people with ADHD, Dyslexia, or Autism. By re-architecting dense content into sensory-specific formats, we ensure that information is accessible to everyone, regardless of their neurological profile.

## 🚨 The Challenge
Standard educational and corporate materials are built for a "neurological average." For neurodivergent individuals, this often leads to:
* **Visual Stress:** Words "swimming" on a page for those with Dyslexia.
* **Task Paralysis:** Overwhelming amounts of text causing ADHD focus crashes.
* **Cognitive Fatigue:** Lack of clear logical structure for Autistic learners.

## ✨ The Solution: NeuroPath
NeuroPath uses **Gemini 3 Pro's multimodal intelligence** to transform static documents (PDFs) and videos into interactive, inclusive experiences:

* **ADHD Focus Mode:** High-level summaries, "sticky" core arguments, and gamified progress.
* **Dyslexia-Friendly Mode:** Re-rendered text using high-contrast themes and accessible fonts (like OpenDyslexic).
* **Logical/Step Mode:** Complex data broken into numbered, non-ambiguous logical steps.
* **Cognitive Ally:** A persistent, context-aware chatbot that acts as a non-judgmental tutor to simplify terms or provide emotional check-ins.

## 📖 Real-World Impact: Maya's Story
*Maya is a law student with Dyslexia and ADHD.* Without NeuroPath, a 60-page legal brief takes her 6 hours of painful effort. With NeuroPath, she converts the brief into a **Dyslexia-friendly font**, uses the **ADHD "Sticky Notes"** to keep the big picture in sight, and asks the **Cognitive Ally** to explain "Certiorari" using a sports metaphor. 
**Result:** Maya finished her prep in 2 hours with 40% higher retention.
